Note on the network usage during the experiment
We experienced a couple of timeout errors while we were scaling up.
The same observation is also visible in the 'x.dat' files in the openstack_experiments/hpa_2/ folder.
This is potentially a compatability issue between kubernetes and cassandra
The effect of the dropped packages is a slight drop in network usage 
but after upscaling the environment stabilizes and the network usage stabilizes.
More interesting is the fact that the network usage drops on both instances
while the CPU Usage remains about the same (or at least doesn't drop as noticebly)

==> Weirdness with cassandra
